    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>I'm a former web designer (back in the good 'ol days of dial up!) turned real estate agent. I miss the creative aspect of web development and the mental challenges of coding. Looking to get back to a web development career and get my skill level into the 21st century. </p>
    <p>Family and friends. Life is empty without 'em! Beyond that, it's important that I make the world a better place, even in small ways. One of my passions is feeding people, especially kids, that may not have healthy food options. No one can better themselves when they're always hungry. </p>

    <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
    <p>I'm originally from Charlottesville, VA and attended the University of Virginia. After about 10 years living in Colorado (what a great experience!), I moved to Annapolis, MD and have enjoyed Chesapeake Bay living ever since.</p>

    <h1>More About Me</h1>
    <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
    <p> I love being creative and my hobbies reflect that. I enjoy making art, music and growing my own food. Anything that educates me on those subjects is a bonus.  </p>
    <h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
    <p>That's a good question. I'm just now figuring that part out but for now, I'd have to say a UX developer that can hang with the backend engineers.</p>
